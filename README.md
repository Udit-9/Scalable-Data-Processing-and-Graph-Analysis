1) Implemented Python-based multi-threaded priority queue for top-k similar items using cosine similarity on high dimensional data. 2) Developed custom MapReduce function with Hadoop-like shuffle and sort to identify frequent bi-grams in large textual data files. 3) Utilized PySpark to count heavy hitter nodes and triangles in large undirected cyclic graphs using scalable analysis techniques
